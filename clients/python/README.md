# Workflows

The following are the general workflow for working with the Python client for Osparc's public API. For brevity `clients/python` will be denoted by PYDIR

Run `make install-dev` from PYDIR to setup the development environment.

### The client code
- The Python client is generated by [openapi-generator](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/openapi-generator). This is done via a docker image is used to generate the cliens is specified in `/scripts/common.Makefile`. To generate the client, run `make python-client` from PYDIR. This generates `clients/python/artifacts/client` which contains all generated code.
- You can generate a wheel or a tar ball from this code by then runnign `make dist` from PYDIR. The artifacts will be places in `clients/python/artifacts/dist`

### The documentation
To generate the documentation, run `make docs` from PYDIR. This generates the client in `clients/python/artifacts/client` and postprocesses the documentation placed there.

## Guidelines
Changes to the client should not be performed within the generated python code, but in the templates in [openapi-generator](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/openapi-generator) so the client can be regenerated whenever new routes are added to the osparc public api server.

*Please do not manually `git commit` auto generated code into this repository*

# Testing
Tests are located in `PYDIR/test` and can be run by executing the following commands from PYDIR:
```bash
make install-test
make test-dev
```
after the client has been generated (see the [workflow section](#workflow)). These tests should test the user-facing API.

# Tips
When modifying templates on the [openapi-generator](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/openapi-generator) repository the pace at which you can progress is determined by the speed at which you can loop through the following diagram

```mermaid
  graph TD;
      A(Modify templates)-->B(Generate client code);
      B-->C(Test generated client);
      C-->D(Figure out persisting issues in the generated client);
      D-->A;
```

Hence, it is important to be able quickly modify the [templates](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/openapi-generator/tree/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources) and regenerate the client. To do this without rebuilding the docker image containing the openapi-generator, run `make python-client-from-templates path/to/template/dir` from `clients/python`.

## Upcoming Deprecations

`osparc.models` and `osparc.api` modules have been (now) deprecated and will be retired/removed in the next version, please used `osparc` to import all the functions instead
